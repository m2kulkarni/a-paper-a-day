# a-paper-a-day
Trying out a new initiative a-paper-a-day. This repo will have the summaries, notes and relevant contents(To see annotations, download the paper, github doesnt support it). Recently I have been annotating papers more than taking notes due to time constraints.

## List of papers with Notes

* [Theoritical Neuroscience: Chapter 8-Learning and plasticity](https://github.com/m2kulkarni/a-paper-a-day/blob/main/notes/learning-and-plasticity-dayan-abbott.pdf)
* [Learning curves for stochastic gradient descent in linear feedforward networks](https://github.com/m2kulkarni/a-paper-a-day/blob/main/notes/learning-curves.pdf)
* [Learning with three factors: Modulating hebbian plasticity with errors](https://github.com/m2kulkarni/a-paper-a-day/blob/main/notes/learning-with-three-factors.pdf)
* [Healthy Academic Work Habits](https://github.com/m2kulkarni/a-paper-a-day/blob/main/notes/healthy-work-habits.pdf)
* [BackPropagation and the Brain](https://github.com/m2kulkarni/a-paper-a-day/blob/main/notes/backprop-and-the-brain.pdf)
